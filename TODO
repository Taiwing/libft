---- TODO ----

- adapt every libft functions that need it to the new ft_errno system

---- MAYBE ----

- The scan filter is set twice at start since it is initialized in the scan
  setup function. Decide if we really want to set it here instead. This not
  really the most efficient way. It would be better to set it only once, but
  then incoming packets should not be filtered by sequence (which is not a
  problem, it can be done after but it requires updating the filters...).
  (for context, this is referring to the ft_scan_set_filter() call in the
  'src/net/ft_scan_send.c' file)

---- FEAT ----

- when genmake will be able to handle more than one level depth sources, move
  sources of get_next_line, ft_printf and ft_getopt into different directories
  in src and in includes

---- FIX ----

- Underflow on line 76 sometimes, somehow, size and info->exp10 probably end up
  having the same value, then -1 is passed as a size parameter to pdata_add (so
  SIZE_MAX) which used to provoke a buffer overflow. The buffer overflow has
  been fixed but the underlying issue still exists. Sometimes, somehow, dragon4
  will return a size value and an exp10 which end up in an error in pdata_add.
