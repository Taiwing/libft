# libft

My full personal library in C, with get_next_line, ft_printf and ft_getopt
included.

infos:

- By default every malloc used in libft funcitions (ft_printf and ft_getopt
  included) are replaced by ft_secmalloc which will exit on failure.
  To disactivate this functionnality and use plain old unprotected malloc,
  libft must be compiled with the flag "-D NO_EXIT_ON_MALLOC_FAIL" in the
  compiler command line (if gcc or clang).
