# libft

My full personal library in C, with get_next_line, ft_printf and ft_getopt
included.

## test

The test directory holds test programs for some libft functions. For
example the test/bint project is a big ints calculator to test the
bint library. It also has automated tests.

## feat

The feat directory is used to develop and test new libft features before
integrating them. This is useful for big experimental features that
require heavy work.
